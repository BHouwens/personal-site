I can't take anything with me when I go, so I just want to make the world a better place while I'm here. On this site you'll find my thoughts on blockchain, machine learning, game theory, UX and product design, self-sufficient living and anything else that sparks interest.

I'm currently working as the Head of Engineering for the blockchain startup [Zenotta](https://zenotta.com).

Originally from ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦, now living in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­
